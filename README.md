### Know your weight

This is my experiment of using [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/) to write an iOS app.

**It is not in progress** since I successfully built a demo version for my iPhone that displays and stores data in local database and *almost* connects to **Healt app**. I achieved the goal. You may use this if you want, but do not forget about [the LICENSE](LICENSE).
